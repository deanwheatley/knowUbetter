# Quiz Mechanics Ideas

## Random Question Selection
- Questions are randomly selected from approved pool
- User cannot receive same question twice if they answered it correctly
- Failed questions can be re-attempted (part of weekly limit)
- Algorithm ensures variety across categories

## Question Format Standardization
- All questions are multiple choice with exactly 3 options
- Consistent UI/UX experience
- Easier to validate and score
- Simpler question creation process

## Weekly Engagement Strategy
- Limited questions per week creates scarcity
- Users must strategize when to use their attempts
- Encourages daily engagement rather than binge sessions
- Props become more valuable as alternative kudos source

## Potential Enhancements (Future)
- Question difficulty could affect weekly limit consumption (2x for hard questions)
- Bonus questions for streaks
- Category-specific weekly limits
- Question trading between users
