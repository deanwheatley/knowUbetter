# knowUbetter MVP Plan

## Props Economy Proposal

### Weekly Props Allowance
- **prop** (10 kudos): 5 per week
- **mad-prop** (50 kudos): 2 per week  
- **prop-hell-yeah** (100 kudos): 1 per week
- **Total weekly props value**: 200 kudos to distribute

### Quiz Kudos (for comparison)
- All questions: 10 kudos each
- Weekly question limit: Admin configurable (default: 20 questions)

**Rationale**: Props should feel special - a basic "prop" equals 1 correct answer. A "prop-hell-yeah" equals 10 correct answers. Weekly limits create scarcity and strategy.
